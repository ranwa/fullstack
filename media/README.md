## **MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE**
### **INTRODUCTION:**
A server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Then use the code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

### Requirements:
1. Installation of Python. For downloading Python, Visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- In this project Python 3.6 (32-bit ) was used.
3. Basic knowledge of Python and HTML Syntax

### Attached Files:
1. The file  _fresh_tomatoes.py_ contains the _open_movies_page()_ function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase your favorite movies.
2. In _media.py_ a movie class is defined with the properties of a movie like:  movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs.
3. A  list of the movie objects is stored in _entertainment_center.py_. By calling the constructor media.Movie() to instantiate movie objects we've given movies their own custom data structure by defining the movie class and constructor, and now these objects can be stored in a list data structure. 

### Get to the Code and Check for Errors:
 - To obtain the code,right click on the file with .py extension and choose edit with IDLE.
